Final Cleaned Response: <think>
Okay, the user asked if I remember their old friend from high school. I need to check my memory first. Let me use the remember tool for that.

Wait, the previous response from the tool mentioned Magic returning in 2011, the Ancients, chromed-out motorcycles, turf wars in the Barrens, and Renraku as a megacorporation. But none of these directly mention a high school friend. The user's query is about a specific person, but the tool's response doesn't include any personal interactions or specific individuals.

Hmm, maybe the user is referring to someone mentioned in the tool's data? Let me check again. The tool's data talks about the Ancients, Magic, Renraku, but no specific person. The memoryType in the tool response was "Miscellaneous" for the Magic part, but that's about an event, not a person.

Since the user is asking about a friend from high school, and the tool's response doesn't have any information about that, I should inform them that I don't recall any specific high school friends. But I need to make sure I'm not making up information. The tool's data doesn't mention any individuals from high school, so I should respond based on that.

Wait, the user might be referring to a character from the lore, but the tool's data doesn't have that. So the answer is that I don't remember. But I should also consider if there's any possibility that the user is thinking of someone else. However, according to the remember tool's response, there's no mention of any specific individuals in the provided data.

So the correct response is to say that I don't recall any specific high school friends. Maybe the user is trying to bring up a previous topic, but based on the current memory, there's no information. Therefore, I should let them know that I don't remember and perhaps ask for more details if they have any.
</think>

I don’t recall any specific high school friends in my memory. The only things I remember are the return of Magic in 2011, the Ancients’ chromed-out motorcycles and turf wars in the Barrens, and Renraku’s focus on computer hardware/software. If you’re thinking of someone else… I’m not sure we’ve ever met. Would you like to tell me more?
